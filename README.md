### 🏀 Overview 
**Moment Rivals** is a strategic basketball trading card game (TCG) built on Flow. Players compete using real NBA Top Shot Moments in fast-paced, head-to-head showdowns.

Each card is a Top Shot Moment reimagined for gameplay — transforming Flow’s largest on-chain asset into real-time strategy.
